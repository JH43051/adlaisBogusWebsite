	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>
		I am a 60 year old man living in a cave in Peru. My hobbies are knitting, baking, and chopping wood(and children). I am a hermit 
		and live with my 15 cats and my tamed rock Fred. My favorite foods are frog legs served over a bed of child hair and for desert
		I whip up a batch of stewed child fingers.

		I'm learning how to code and Cool John is teaching me. I am at my grandparents house right 
		now and we just had Christmas. I went to the zoo and the coolest animal was the four tusked boar. I just baked red velvet
		cheesecake bites and choclate zuccini bread. For dinner
		I made asparagus and laasagna.
